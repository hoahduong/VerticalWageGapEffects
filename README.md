# VerticalWageGapEffects

Wage and compensation vary across individuals, companies, and positions because of different
compensation systems. In evaluating the effciency the increased pay from a promotion
that is part of these various compensation systems, Rank-Order Tournament Theory states
that implementing a compensation scheme based on an individual's relative position within
the firm can increase employees' effort and the firm's performance. According to this theory,
this compensation structure should have widening pay gaps along the corporate hierarchy.
Using data from the Specialty Store Wage and Benefit Survey provided by the National
Retail Federation (NRF), this paper tests the existence and the effects of this compensation
structure in the retail industry. The dataset contains aggregated information on the number
of employees and their average annual salary in each hierarchical level of large national retail
chains for the years 1996-1998. With a new approach centering around the second differences
between the pay levels, using different statistical tests, including polynomial regression
and t-test, we found empirical evidence supporting the existence of a convex compensation
structure in the retail industry, where pay level increases at an increasing rate, consistent
with the tournament theory. However, through the two-sample t-test and error-in-variables
regression, we found that neither the presence of a convex compensation system nor the
convexity of this compensation scheme has a statistically significant influence on the firm's
performance. The results of this study will solidify the implications of the tournament theory
under organizational settings.
